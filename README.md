# AzureStorageSwift

A Swift Package for Azure Storage access on macOS & iOS, providing simple and efficient Blob container interactions.

> **Note**: This package is forked from the deprecated [Azure Storage iOS SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-ios). While functional for basic operations, consider using the officially maintained [Azure SDK for iOS](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios) for production applications.

## Features

- Basic Blob container operations (upload, download, delete)
- Support for both macOS and iOS platforms
- Simple integration via Swift Package Manager
- Lightweight alternative to the full Azure SDK

## Prerequisites

- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com)
- Azure Storage Account and Blob Container
  - [Quick Start Guide: Create Storage Account and Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal)
- SAS (Shared Access Signature) Key for authentication
  - [Guide: Managing Storage Account Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal)
