# AzureStorageSwift 

A Swift Package for Azure Storage access on macOS & iOS  

**Forked from the deprecated [Azure Storage iOS SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-ios), now with Swift Package Manager (SPM) support.**  

> ⚠️ *This repository is a fork of the original Azure Storage SDK for iOS, which was no longer maintained and did not support macOS. To use it in a macOS application, I initially had to copy the source code locally. This fork now includes full Swift Package Manager (SPM) support, making it easier to integrate into projects. While the codebase is older and newer libraries exist, it remains functional for my needs. Eventually, I plan to migrate to a more modern solution, but in the meantime, hopefully you'll find this useful.*
